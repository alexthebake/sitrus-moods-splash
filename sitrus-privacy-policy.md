# Privacy Policy

Sitrus built the Sitrus Moods app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Sitrus at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.

If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at Sitrus Moods unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

**Information Collection and Use**

While using our service no personally identifiable information (PII) is collected.

* No registration is required to use the app.
* All data is hosted locally on the phone.
* The app makes no network connections and no data is sent off the user's phone.

The app does not use any third party services beyond Google Play Services that collect information used to identify you.

* [Google Play Services](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/)

**Cookies**

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

This Service does not use “cookies”. No cookies will be created or stored on the user's device.

**Service Providers**

We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

*   To facilitate our Service;
*   To provide the Service on our behalf;
*   To perform Service-related services; or
*   To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.

These third parties do not have access to any of the user's personal information or data. 

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information. We will not sell, trade, or transfer to outside parties anonymized data.

**Security**

Sitrus strives to use commercially acceptable means of protecting the user and their data.
However no method of electronic storage or transmission over the internet is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Because users do not need to register to use the app and no information is collected off the user's phone, our servers do not haave any of the user's data. We do not collect credit card numbers.

**Links to Other Sites**

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

**COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act) and Children's Privacy**

When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.

We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.

This Services does not address anyone under the age of 13\. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13\. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to do necessary actions.

**California Online Privacy Protection Act**

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf

According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following: Users can visit our site anonymously. Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website. Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.

You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:

* On our Privacy Policy Page

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
